             <h1>HOW EDUCATION CAN CHANGE THE LIVES OF UNDERPRIVILEGED CHILDREN</h1>
             <p className="about-para">By giving good education to these children we will not only help them but also can secure the living of their parents and their future, those parents who are not capable enough to give education and a brighter life to their children. There are ample reasons as to why they need education and how it is important for them. It will help them to improve themselves and learn new things, find good opportunities, become a good human being and lead a respectable life in the society with their head high.  The more education these children will acquire, the higher is the chance to create a good life for their family.</p>
